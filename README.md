If you don't know who's gonna merge your Pull Request - Oraclocat knows!

## Before you can ask...

create a developers.rb file in oraclocats main directory defining a hash
of available developers like
    
    DEVELOPERS = {
        "Nathan der Weise" => { github: "@nathan" }
      }

developers.rb will be ignored by git to keep it agnostic.
